# PowerHop
A OOP program inspired by Frogger, with added powerups and modes. The user will try to get a frog across the screen. They will first have to cross a road while avoiding cars and then they will have to use logs to cross a river. They will be able to collect powerups which will give them special abilities such as shields or longer jump distance.
