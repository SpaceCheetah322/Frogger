# PowerHop (edited by kai and Ava)
A OOP program inspired by Frogger, with added powerups and modes. The user will try to get a frog across the screen while avoiding obstacles (eg: crossing a road while dodging cars, using logs to cross a river). They will be able to collect powerups, in the form of bugs scattered around the level, which will give them special abilities such as shields or longer jump distance.

# Roles
* Ava - main class
* Kai - player class
* Sofia - car and log class
* Katelyn - fly and powerup class
